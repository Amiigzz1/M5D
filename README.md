# llm-redteam-core

This repository contains a minimal placeholder for a Laravel based project. Only a few configuration files are present and no actual application code has been committed yet.

## Quick start

1. Install **PHP 8.2+** and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
2. Install **Node.js** and run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings as needed.
4. Generate the application key with `php artisan key:generate`.
5. Start the development server via `php artisan serve`.

Until the full application is added you can verify your PHP installation by running

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 index.php
```

which will render the temporary `index.php` script included in this repository.
