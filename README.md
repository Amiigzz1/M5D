# llm-redteam-core

A starter Laravel project skeleton. Basic application files have been added so you can run the framework locally.

## Quick start

1. Install **PHP 8.2+** and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
2. Install **Node.js** and run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings as needed.
4. Run `composer install` to fetch PHP dependencies.
5. Generate the application key with `php artisan key:generate`.
6. Start the development server with `php artisan serve`.

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the default welcome page.

Laravel's directory structure has been added in a minimal form. Additional configuration and application code can be built on top of this foundation.
